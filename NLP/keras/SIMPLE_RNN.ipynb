    "A major characteristic of feedforward networks is that these networks take in arbitrary feature vectors with fixed, predetermined input sizes, along with their associated weights and had no hidden state. With feedforward networks, in order to process a sequence of data points, the entire sequence is considered as a single input for the network to process and capture all relevant information at once in a single step. This makes it difficult to deal with sequences of varying length and fails to capture important information. Sequential data usually involve variable lenght inputs, so instead of processing the data point in just a single step, we need a model that will still consider a sequence as a single input to the network but instead of processing it in a single step, ita will internally loop over the sequence elements taking each element as an input and maintaining a state containing information relative to what it has seen so far and this is the idea behind RNNS.\n",

    " An assumption of feedforward networks is that the inputs are independent (one input has no dependency on another) of one another, however in sequential data such as textual data (we will limit ourselves to textual data since it is the most widespread forms of sequence data), this assumption is not true, since in a sentence the occurrence of a word influences or is influenced by the occurrences of other words in the sentence. \n",
    " \n",
    " When processing data, RNNs assumes that an incoming data take the form of a sequence of vectors or tensors, which can be sequences of word or sequences of characters as in textual data, sequence of observations over a period of time as in time series etc.  As RNNs process the data, RNNs have recurrent connections that allows a memory to persist in the network’s internal state keeping track of information observed so far and informing the decisions to be made by the network at later points in time and also share parameters across different parts of the network making it possible to extend and apply the network to inputs of variable lengths and generalize across them. This makes RNNs useful for Timeseries forecasting and natural language processing (NLP) systems such as document classification, sentiment analysis, automatic translation, generating text for applications such as chatbots. Since the same parameters are used for all time steps, the parameterization cost of an RNN does not grow as the number of time steps increases."

      "b\"Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist, Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers. But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework. As might be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer, there's a definite element of 'Cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of the Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie. Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con.<br /><br />The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it's got a lot going for it all the same. Not worth starting a new religion over, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?\" \n",
